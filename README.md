This is my bash configuration and stuff.

## Installation: ##

# Clone the repo to ~/environment
# Source the file from .bashrc (and maybe .bash_profile)
# ???
# Profit!

In commands, this means:

```
$ cd
$ git clone git://github.com/stwalkerster/environment.git environment
$ echo ". ~/environment/bashrc" >> ~/.bashrc
